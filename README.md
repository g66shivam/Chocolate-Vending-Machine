# Chocolate-Vending-Machine-Proteus-Simulation
Simulation of an embeded system which resembles a chocolate vending machine using intel 8086 microprocessor
## About The Project
The aim was to design an embedded system using intel 8086 as the core microprocessor which behaves like a choclate vending machine. The machine dispenses appropriate number of chocolates based on the number of input coins.
